3
00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:09.506
<i>So... I know what you're thinking.</i>

4
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.844
<i>Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog</i>

5
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.208
<i>being chased by a mad man
with a mustache from the civil war?</i>

6
00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:19.200
<i>Gotta be honest, it feels like
I've been running my whole life.</i>

7
00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.773
<i>Is this too much? Am I going too fast?</i>

8
00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.972
<i>It's kinda what I do.
You know what? Let's back up.</i>

9
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:35.421
<i>This is the island where I am from.</i>

10
00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:40.076
<i>It had everything: sandy beaches,
cascading waterfalls,</i>

11
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.188
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

12
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.177
<i>And I never had to catch a school bus</i>

13
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:48.191
<i>because I can run across the entire island
in less than two seconds.</i>

14
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.154
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

15
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.783
<i>I know, pretty sweet island, right?</i>

16
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:58.132
<i>I was born with extraordinary powers,
and was told to keep them in secret.</i>

17
00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:01.381
<i>And like any kid, I did the exact opposite.</i>

18
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.113
<i>That's Longclaw, she took care of me.</i>

19
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:10.511
<i>She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi,
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.</i>

20
00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.201
Sonic, someone could've seen you!

21
00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:16.176
No one saw me. I am too fast!

22
00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:18.719
And, I wanted to bring you this.

23
00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:23.656
Get down!

24
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.740
<i>Turns out with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.</i>

25
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.254
<i>And I let them right to us.</i>

26
00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:49.432
Listen carefully, Sonic.

27
00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:53.006
You have a power unlike anything
I've ever seen.

28
00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:55.693
And that means someone
will always want it.

29
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.895
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

30
00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.890
This word is on the farthest side
of the universe. You should be safe there.

31
00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:09.707
- I don't wanna go without you!
- You must!

32
00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:12.923
These rings will be your most important
possession.

33
00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:18.981
If you ever discovered, use one.

34
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:23.027
Never stop running. Now go!

35
00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:29.226
Longclaw!

36
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.371
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

37
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.757
No!

38
00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:03.795
C'mon, one car?

39
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.169
I'm bored.

40
00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.980
Tom, do you read me?
Are you there?

41
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.651
No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht
in Barbados

42
00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:22.730
with Rihanna.

43
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.942
OMG. That's amazing, please send pics.

44
00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:28.076
No, Wade, I'm at the speed trap.

45
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.735
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean.

46
00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.024
Hang on, I think I got something.

47
00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:43.143
Hey, buddy, where's the fire?

48
00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:45.635
We've got kids living around here.

49
00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:49.043
It was kinda funny, sorry.

50
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.544
What?

51
00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:39.583
<i>Tom, we need you down on Main Street.
There's been a violent gang shoot-out.</i>

52
00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.857
<i>Just kidding, a dog stole a bagel.
But they do need it back.</i>

53
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.841
Buddy, you almost got yourself killed
out there.

54
00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:01.972
What are you, some kind
of an adrenaline junkie?

55
00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.194
Must be rough being slow all the time.

56
00:06:04.244 --> 00:06:07.871
I'll tell you what,
today is your lucky day.

57
00:06:11.908 --> 00:06:14.377
Have you ever felt so alive?

58
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.943
This is great, you're doing amazing.

59
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:19.801
Oh, jeez!

60
00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:22.637
Good recovery!

61
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.340
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

62
00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:30.542
You never saw me.
I was never here.

63
00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:46.850
<i>So, what were you expecting?</i>

64
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:50.566
<i>A dirty little hedgehog eating berries,
and struggling to survive?</i>

65
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:55.231
<i>Think again, because I am living
my best life on Earth.</i>

66
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.995
<i>I've got a library.</i>

67
00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.170
<i>A home gym.</i>

68
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.742
<i>And a state of the art security system.</i>

69
00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.139
Oh, no!

70
00:07:17.608 --> 00:07:20.710
<i>And if I ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions,</i>

71
00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:23.420
<i>and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.</i>

72
00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:27.458
<i>A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.</i>

73
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.137
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms...</i>

74
00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:34.873
I hate mushrooms.

75
00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:38.148
<i>But let's not worry about all of that.</i>

76
00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.856
<i>This is Green Hills.</i>

77
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:43.261
<i>The greatest place on Earth.</i>

78
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:49.167
<i>These are my people, and there, I say,
I am their lovable space creature.</i>

79
00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.771
<i>So what if they don't know I exist?</i>

80
00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:56.090
<i>My favorite person is the Donut Lord.</i>

81
00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:59.025
<i>Protector of this town,</i>

82
00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:02.566
<i>and defender of all creatures,
big and small.</i>

83
00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:05.323
Morning, Donald, Daisy, Daffy.

84
00:08:06.514 --> 00:08:08.955
<i>Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady.</i>

85
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.177
<i>She is super nice to animals,
and strangely was born without bones.</i>

86
00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:20.032
<i>There is one person in town
who's actually onto me.</i>

87
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.254
<i>He calls me The Blue Devil.</i>

88
00:08:22.444 --> 00:08:25.861
- I almost caught him last night.
- <i>Say hello to Crazy Carl.</i>

89
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.721
<i>We have fun together.</i>

90
00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:35.386
I know you're out there!

91
00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:38.190
And I know you're real!

92
00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:40.552
No, I'm not.

93
00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:43.490
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

94
00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.254
Please, please...

95
00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:48.747
Yes! Keanu, you are a national treasure.

96
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.267
<i>- When I find you...
- Pop quiz hot-shot.</i>

97
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.947
<i>There's a bomb on the bus.</i>

98
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:56.328
Pop quiz hot-shot.
The classic line.

99
00:08:57.021 --> 00:08:59.303
<i>Basically, we're like a family,</i>

100
00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:01.403
<i>even though we haven't met yet.</i>

101
00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:06.361
You don't think your prolonged isolation
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

102
00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:10.979
Crazy? Me? No way, Doc.
You got me all wrong.

103
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.091
And despite all these
so called friends of yours,

104
00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:17.299
deep down you are still rather lonely?

105
00:09:22.964 --> 00:09:26.280
<i>Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?</i>

106
00:09:41.845 --> 00:09:43.926
Hey! No, no...

107
00:09:44.596 --> 00:09:48.252
Get out of there! Come on!
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

108
00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.055
Get out of there, you trash pandas!

109
00:09:52.623 --> 00:09:55.301
Maddie, as Green Hills
most respected veterinary,

110
00:09:55.475 --> 00:09:58.252
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a racoon?

111
00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:01.238
Hi, Ozzy. Hello.
You're glad to see me?

112
00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:02.934
You don't eat garbage, do you?

113
00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.833
What's that?

114
00:10:05.198 --> 00:10:07.685
- Is that what I think it is?
- Open it.

115
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.568
- It's kinda small, is that bad?
- Just... open it.

116
00:10:18.377 --> 00:10:20.461
Dear Thomas, we have reviewed
your application

117
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.280
to the San Francisco Police Department,

118
00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:25.009
and pending inter departmental review
and background check.

119
00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:29.030
And we are happy to inform you that you
have been selected to join our team.

120
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.298
Wow! Oh my God!

121
00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:35.864
San Francisco sucks?

122
00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:39.657
Wrong one.

123
00:10:44.264 --> 00:10:46.393
- You never had a doubt, huh?
- No!

124
00:10:49.424 --> 00:10:52.462
- I can't believe this!
- I know. You did it!

125
00:10:54.196 --> 00:10:55.828
What are those?

126
00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:59.241
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

127
00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:02.093
I though Ozzy and I
can fly there tomorrow,

128
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.566
and check out some neighborhoods.

129
00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:07.326
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

130
00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:13.331
Man, it's the craziest thing,
you apply for the job, you get the job.

131
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:15.591
- Well, pending a background check.
- Oh, man,

132
00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:19.394
hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's WiFi.

133
00:11:19.563 --> 00:11:22.032
Correction, I'm still using
the neighbor's WiFi.

134
00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:23.723
But, Maddie...

135
00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.730
Are you sure you're okay with this?

136
00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:27.467
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

137
00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:30.102
what did you do the entire time
I was in a veterinary school?

138
00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:32.222
I worked the second job
to pay the rent, and...

139
00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:34.239
A third job to pay tuition.

140
00:11:34.397 --> 00:11:38.440
You sacrificed for me,
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

141
00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:42.275
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

142
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:47.301
I mean, there's been a Wachowski protecting
this town for more than 50 years.

143
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.307
This is a big change.

144
00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:52.437
I'm positive.

145
00:11:53.368 --> 00:11:55.776
It's time for this guy to get out there
and prove himself.

146
00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:57.764
I love Green Hills, but...

147
00:11:57.909 --> 00:12:00.210
You know, I wanna help people
in real trouble.

148
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.330
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-or-death situation,

149
00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:05.050
and I'll be there for them.

150
00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:09.814
- I get it. I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

151
00:12:11.492 --> 00:12:13.706
And so it is with a heavy heart,
that I tell you all

152
00:12:13.852 --> 00:12:16.935
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department

153
00:12:17.123 --> 00:12:18.651
effective immediately.

154
00:12:18.882 --> 00:12:22.148
It's gonna be tough to leave my home town,
and all my friendships.

155
00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.493
But this is something
I feel like I need to do,

156
00:12:26.487 --> 00:12:30.815
to grow, as both an officer, and a man.

157
00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:36.134
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

158
00:12:36.968 --> 00:12:38.661
That wasn't so bad, right?

159
00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:41.805
Now all I gotta do is...

160
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.413
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

161
00:12:46.543 --> 00:12:48.952
Whoa, the play-offs.

162
00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:35.400
So cool.

163
00:13:39.657 --> 00:13:41.069
We're at the ninth, tie score.

164
00:13:41.217 --> 00:13:44.826
And exactly who you want at the plate
with a game on the line, Sonic.

165
00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:46.895
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

166
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.317
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills, also Sonic.

167
00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:52.842
Okay, focus, Sonic.

168
00:13:52.997 --> 00:13:56.587
If you win this game you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

169
00:14:00.449 --> 00:14:04.127
Hit it to the guy in left,
he's a real space case.

170
00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:08.998
I can't with that guy.

171
00:14:09.187 --> 00:14:13.300
Hey, batter Sonic, hey, batter Sonic,
is so in batter Sonic.

172
00:14:20.691 --> 00:14:22.176
I got it, I got it...

173
00:14:23.343 --> 00:14:24.859
I don't got it.

174
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:35.499
Go home! Go home!

175
00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:37.511
Come on!

176
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:43.934
Safe!

177
00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:48.396
Yes! Yes! I did it!

178
00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:51.242
Did you see that? I did it! I did it.

179
00:15:04.444 --> 00:15:06.467
I really am alone.

180
00:15:07.025 --> 00:15:09.626
All alone. Forever.

181
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.921
I'm sure no one noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

182
00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.999
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom. Wade here.

183
00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:02.719
What is going on?

184
00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:05.247
- Oh Gosh, I think the power is out.
- Yap, dur.

185
00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.894
The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

186
00:16:08.294 --> 00:16:09.987
- What should I do?
- Okay. Relax.

187
00:16:10.113 --> 00:16:11.951
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

188
00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:14.565
see if they can locate
the down line, then...

189
00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:17.858
call Zim, and see if he can get
his generator over to the Super Cue

190
00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:22.880
- so the food stays fresh.
- Call Zim before Gil?

191
00:16:23.428 --> 00:16:25.841
- Call Gil... Hello? Wait. Wait!
- I'll call you back.

192
00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:28.526
Hello? Was that the end
of the instructions?

193
00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:32.216
Okay. All right. You can do this.

194
00:16:33.062 --> 00:16:36.275
What was the first thing he said to do?

195
00:16:37.852 --> 00:16:39.911
Right. Relax.

196
00:17:00.222 --> 00:17:03.126
Twenty minutes ago an energy surge
knocked our power

197
00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:05.845
across the entire Pacific Northwest.
What do we know?

198
00:17:06.044 --> 00:17:08.409
Our first instinct was it was an EMP.

199
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.910
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

200
00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:14.542
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

201
00:17:14.672 --> 00:17:17.615
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

202
00:17:17.719 --> 00:17:20.550
Sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

203
00:17:20.678 --> 00:17:22.768
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

204
00:17:22.907 --> 00:17:26.125
I'm suggesting we scramble the fifth and sixth regiment.
- No, no...

205
00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:30.466
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.
Someone who understands technology.

206
00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:33.310
- You wanna send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

207
00:17:33.475 --> 00:17:34.635
A lab rat with the teeth.

208
00:17:34.737 --> 00:17:37.153
You're not suggesting who I think
you're suggesting.

209
00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:39.177
- I know he's a little weird...
- Weird?

210
00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:41.758
- No, no. No way!
- He's a psychological terrifier.

211
00:17:41.883 --> 00:17:45.191
But he's also brilliant. Five PhDs.
IQ off the charts.

212
00:17:45.353 --> 00:17:47.979
And his drone tech is revolutionary.

213
00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.851
- You're sure he can handle this?
- He has a perfect operations record.

214
00:17:52.159 --> 00:17:54.062
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

215
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.923
- Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?
- It's not even a country.

216
00:17:57.055 --> 00:18:00.049
Exactly. And you can thank
Robotnik for that.

217
00:18:00.187 --> 00:18:03.450
I can't believe you're bringing
that freak into this.

218
00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:06.081
Neither can I, but...

219
00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:08.028
We have no choice.

220
00:18:16.072 --> 00:18:17.636
Guys, coming up!

221
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.593
Yes, Major.

222
00:18:33.798 --> 00:18:34.875
What a...

223
00:18:56.389 --> 00:18:57.704
Are you in charge here?

224
00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:00.241
- Yes, I am.
- No. Wrong!

225
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.684
- Name...
- I'm in charge!

226
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:03.181
- Me!
- Is Major...

227
00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:05.317
- Ben...
- I'm in charge.

228
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.530
You've never seen anything
like this before?

229
00:19:08.765 --> 00:19:13.108
It says I'm a top banana in a world
full of hungry little monkeys.

230
00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:14.951
Allow me to clarify.

231
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:18.462
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance

232
00:19:18.592 --> 00:19:21.650
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify. Agent Stone.

233
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.424
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.
- I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

234
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:28.160
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

235
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.083
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

236
00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:33.353
Tell him to stop or I'll pull out
his search history.

237
00:19:33.466 --> 00:19:36.007
If you don't stop looking, the Doctor,
he'll take a closer look...

238
00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:39.289
- I'm not deaf.
- And tell him his men report to me now.

239
00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:42.894
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you're realize...

240
00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:44.704
I'm sorry, Major, what was your name?

241
00:19:44.848 --> 00:19:48.292
- Benning...
- Nobody cares! Nobody cares.

242
00:19:48.584 --> 00:19:50.792
Listen, Major Nobodycares.

243
00:19:50.938 --> 00:19:53.088
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

244
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:56.107
Because nobody cares about your feeble
accomplishments.

245
00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:58.713
And nobody cares about how proud
your Mommy is

246
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.297
that you're now reading
at a third grade level.

247
00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:06.010
Have you finished 'Charlotte's Web' yet?
Spoiler alert, she dies in the end.

248
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.771
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

249
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.540
Oh, my babies.

250
00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:15.668
Look what came out of my egg sac.

251
00:20:15.857 --> 00:20:17.940
You know what I love about machines?

252
00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:21.999
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

253
00:20:22.185 --> 00:20:25.759
They don't need time-off to get drunk,
and put the boat in the water.

254
00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:28.098
And you do what you're told.

255
00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:30.725
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss.

256
00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:34.228
And watch my machines do your job.

257
00:20:36.654 --> 00:20:39.445
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

258
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.433
It's evolution, Stone.

259
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:44.600
It's evolution!

260
00:21:19.802 --> 00:21:21.960
- Agent Stone?
- Doctor.

261
00:21:22.402 --> 00:21:24.612
Do you see anything useful in this image?

262
00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:27.923
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

263
00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.242
Your eyes weren't expertly trained
to spot tracks

264
00:21:30.405 --> 00:21:32.672
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

265
00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:44.332
That's extraordinary.

266
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.710
No, what extraordinary is...

267
00:21:46.863 --> 00:21:50.544
I determined the exact height, weight,
and spinal curvature of this creature.

268
00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.569
And my computer can't find
a single match for it, anywhere

269
00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:56.144
in Earth's animal kingdom.

270
00:21:56.445 --> 00:22:00.732
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby Bigfoot.

271
00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:04.400
This guy is something else

272
00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:07.785
entirely.

273
00:22:08.147 --> 00:22:10.951
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

274
00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:13.990
That's one small step for man,

275
00:22:14.148 --> 00:22:16.475
one giant leap for me.

276
00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:29.753
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

277
00:22:29.913 --> 00:22:31.965
You played some baseball,
got a little upset.

278
00:22:32.114 --> 00:22:35.375
Lightning shut out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

279
00:22:36.005 --> 00:22:38.069
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

280
00:22:38.199 --> 00:22:41.025
Time for plan B - Mushroomville.
I gotta take my stuff.

281
00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:43.013
Okay, essential items only.

282
00:22:43.156 --> 00:22:45.913
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night light, funny hat.

283
00:22:46.294 --> 00:22:49.161
This half-eaten cantaloupe,
and my scented candle.

284
00:22:49.513 --> 00:22:51.147
My entire comic book collection.

285
00:22:51.261 --> 00:22:53.932
Bean bag chair, can a bean bag chair
fit in the backpack? No, no.

286
00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:55.545
Of course not. That's stupid.

287
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.965
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course!

288
00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:03.663
Here we go. Ring time.
Mushroom planet, here I come.

289
00:23:04.369 --> 00:23:07.364
Oh, no! They're right outside,
I gotta go somewhere else.

290
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:13.998
Goodbye, cave.

291
00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:19.505
- Hi.
- Hey.

292
00:23:19.673 --> 00:23:20.713
What are you doing?

293
00:23:20.868 --> 00:23:23.596
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

294
00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:25.609
That sounds half-fun.

295
00:23:25.754 --> 00:23:28.064
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

296
00:23:28.217 --> 00:23:30.022
The whole town went dark.

297
00:23:30.141 --> 00:23:32.319
It was like a sign telling me
to get outta Dodge.

298
00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:34.324
- Wade must've lost his mind.
- Yeah.

299
00:23:34.563 --> 00:23:36.479
And he does not have much to lose.

300
00:23:36.713 --> 00:23:39.299
How's your sister? Does she
convince you to leave me yet?

301
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.744
No, but she did tell me to check
your phone for dating apps.

302
00:23:42.895 --> 00:23:45.326
The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.

303
00:23:45.488 --> 00:23:47.699
- And the Olive Garden.
- Ah, because when you're there...

304
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.542
You're family.

305
00:23:51.167 --> 00:23:52.863
No way!

306
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:58.619
The racoons are back.
And they are in for a surprise.

307
00:23:58.746 --> 00:24:02.125
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun. They're just hungry.

308
00:24:02.385 --> 00:24:04.854
And also, that's for bears.

309
00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:07.786
- Good, now I know it'll work.
- Tom!

310
00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:10.340
I'm kidding, I'm just gonna use it
to scare them.

311
00:24:10.454 --> 00:24:13.002
- Possibly to death. Love you, honey, bye.
- To...

312
00:24:17.547 --> 00:24:20.273
D-I-V-O-R-S-E.

313
00:24:22.388 --> 00:24:26.229
Okay, I'm in. With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

314
00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:28.305
Here we go.

315
00:24:28.412 --> 00:24:31.735
Didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay.
You're going to a safe world.

316
00:24:31.871 --> 00:24:37.316
A nice safe world full of mushrooms.
Mushrooms there will be your only friends.

317
00:24:37.404 --> 00:24:39.362
That sounds awful, I can't do this.

318
00:24:39.507 --> 00:24:41.753
You have to do it,
there's no other option.

319
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.159
All right.

320
00:24:46.183 --> 00:24:49.558
SFPD, pending background check.
Paws in the air!

321
00:24:52.175 --> 00:24:54.331
Uhhh... meow?

322
00:25:02.985 --> 00:25:05.919
San Francisco?

323
00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:29.565
No.

324
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.325
What?

325
00:25:58.097 --> 00:25:59.725
The Blue Devil.

326
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.579
- Donut Lord?
- You can talk?

327
00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:16.805
You're not...

328
00:26:16.969 --> 00:26:19.980
- You're not here to abduct me, are you?
- You abducted me!

329
00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:23.509
Okay, it's a fair point. What are you?

330
00:26:23.741 --> 00:26:25.439
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

331
00:26:25.573 --> 00:26:26.773
I needed somewhere safe,

332
00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:29.460
and you are the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

333
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.344
- Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?
- 'Cause you talk to donuts,

334
00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:34.381
and then eat them
if they get out of the line.

335
00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:36.808
- Again, fair.
- Wait... Where are all the mushrooms?

336
00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:41.456
Why am I still on Earth? What did...
Oh, no, I lost my rings!

337
00:26:41.573 --> 00:26:42.972
What?

338
00:26:48.443 --> 00:26:50.838
What's happening?
Is this your mothership?

339
00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:54.471
- I'm not in the mood to get probed.
- You think you're worried?

340
00:26:54.596 --> 00:26:56.238
I'm not even wearing pants.

341
00:26:59.762 --> 00:27:01.117
What a...

342
00:27:02.518 --> 00:27:04.763
- They're coming for me!
- Who's coming for you?

343
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:07.511
- What does that have to do with me?
- I don't have time to explain,

344
00:27:07.638 --> 00:27:10.324
- but you have to help me.
- No, I don't. Why?

345
00:27:10.473 --> 00:27:13.795
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons

346
00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:15.115
feel like spaghetti.

347
00:27:15.213 --> 00:27:18.356
I need your help, please.
It's life or death.

348
00:27:25.751 --> 00:27:27.571
Fine, come with me.

349
00:27:30.988 --> 00:27:32.602
Little help?

350
00:27:43.463 --> 00:27:46.641
- All right, stay here. And be quiet.
- Good plan, great plan.

351
00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.641
How are we working so well together?
Practically finishing each other sentences.

352
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:53.099
Okay, bye.

353
00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:58.035
Hello there.

354
00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:00.288
Can I help you?

355
00:28:03.717 --> 00:28:05.791
Good morning, my rural chum.

356
00:28:06.287 --> 00:28:07.414
I'm...

357
00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:10.170
from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

358
00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:13.569
If you don't mind I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

359
00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:15.629
No kidding, you're from
the power company?

360
00:28:15.765 --> 00:28:18.706
You must know my buddy Spencer.
We play softball together.

361
00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.489
Spence, he's a good man.

362
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.317
- Yeah, yeah... come on in!
- Great.

363
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.759
Take all the readings
you need. Except...

364
00:28:28.725 --> 00:28:31.994
Don't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

365
00:28:32.112 --> 00:28:34.385
That way they can check
even if you're not home.

366
00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:37.139
Also, my buddy Spencer
works at the gas company.

367
00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:40.208
And he's more of an ultimate Frisbee guy.
So, you wanna tell me why

368
00:28:40.505 --> 00:28:43.815
you think I'm dumb enough
to just let you walk inside my house?

369
00:28:51.757 --> 00:28:54.270
- I'm sorry, Mr...?
- Wachowski.

370
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:55.965
But everyone calls me Tom.

371
00:28:56.183 --> 00:28:58.203
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

372
00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:01.807
But it's go on for so long now that
it would be just weird if I corrected him.

373
00:29:01.953 --> 00:29:04.054
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim.

374
00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:08.238
You may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

375
00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:10.206
Yup, no lights, picked up on that.

376
00:29:10.257 --> 00:29:12.277
Twenty minutes ago I tracked
an energy pulse

377
00:29:12.406 --> 00:29:15.554
with the similar signature to the one
that caused that disruption.

378
00:29:30.234 --> 00:29:31.996
Listen, Mr...?

379
00:29:32.143 --> 00:29:34.708
Doctor. Doctor Robotnik.

380
00:29:34.887 --> 00:29:36.747
But my dentist calls me Rob.

381
00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:41.126
Look, Doctor Robotskiz...

382
00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:43.697
I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

383
00:29:43.827 --> 00:29:46.636
but it's got nothing to do with me,
you can ask anyone in town.

384
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.438
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

385
00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:51.000
I'm sure you hella popular
with a Gabs and Murls

386
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:54.330
and Billy Bobs in this glorified
gas station rest stop.

387
00:29:54.648 --> 00:29:58.702
Which goes way back to the days
of tipping cows and playing on a jug band.

388
00:30:01.612 --> 00:30:04.400
And maybe some day
you've achieved your goal

389
00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:07.318
of getting a Costco card,
or adopting a Labradoodle.

390
00:30:07.476 --> 00:30:12.746
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do

391
00:30:14.624 --> 00:30:16.521
before I was a toddler.

392
00:30:16.672 --> 00:30:20.243
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

393
00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:22.945
- I was breastfed, actually.
- Nice.

394
00:30:23.179 --> 00:30:25.395
Rub that in my orphan face.

395
00:30:25.613 --> 00:30:31.418
Mr. Wachowski, are you familiar
with US code 904, title 10, article 104?

396
00:30:32.781 --> 00:30:34.581
- Yeah...
- Anyone, who attempts to aid

397
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.572
an enemy of the United States
shall suffer death.

398
00:30:39.444 --> 00:30:41.449
And if I'm the one who catches you,

399
00:30:41.914 --> 00:30:43.769
it'll be even worse.

400
00:30:45.171 --> 00:30:46.621
Worse than death?

401
00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:50.545
Okay, I'm a ball.
Just a normal ball.

402
00:30:50.692 --> 00:30:51.953
I'm blending in like a bulge.

403
00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:55.847
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic!

404
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:58.101
Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me
with X-Rays,

405
00:30:58.234 --> 00:31:00.498
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

406
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.301
Don't freak out. Don't freak...
Don't freak out.

407
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.457
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

408
00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:15.270
I'm freaking out!

409
00:31:17.673 --> 00:31:20.084
Why don't you had
your staircase carpeted?

410
00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:21.580
Compared to...

411
00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:25.938
- Old pipes.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:26.088 --> 00:31:28.729
Probably just the house settling.
Nothing to see here.

413
00:31:30.328 --> 00:31:31.595
Hey!

414
00:31:36.716 --> 00:31:38.192
Here's the thing.

415
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.472
I'm never wrong.

416
00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:44.558
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

417
00:31:44.701 --> 00:31:45.902
Would you like some cake?

418
00:31:46.085 --> 00:31:50.217
I hear racoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

419
00:32:01.498 --> 00:32:03.261
Look at that.

420
00:32:03.768 --> 00:32:05.419
I was right.

421
00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:07.761
Note the lack of surprise.

422
00:32:07.958 --> 00:32:09.687
Should we try this again?

423
00:32:20.192 --> 00:32:24.413
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is. Five.

424
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.621
- I don't know what's you're talking about.
- Four.

425
00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.146
Hey, tough guy, I'm a cop.
And you're threatening an Officer.

426
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.947
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed? Three.

427
00:32:32.516 --> 00:32:34.509
Come on, rack your brain!

428
00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:37.963
You might be able to come up
with some lame excuse to go on living.

429
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:39.674
In two...

430
00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:41.679
One!

431
00:32:42.045 --> 00:32:44.008
Wait! Don't hurt him.

432
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.250
This feels excessive.

433
00:33:02.695 --> 00:33:03.837
Stay behind me.

434
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.493
Don't worry, I got it
right where I want it.

435
00:33:25.073 --> 00:33:28.497
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these thing?

436
00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:33.742
This was a horrible plan,
what was I thinking?

437
00:33:36.371 --> 00:33:38.042
I'm gonna puke!

438
00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:42.780
Come on!

439
00:33:43.705 --> 00:33:44.960
We gotta get out of here.

440
00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:48.189
Don't tell me that's all you've got.
I'm just getting started.

441
00:33:48.314 --> 00:33:51.045
Let me know if you wanna go
round two with the blue.

442
00:34:09.872 --> 00:34:11.037
Doctor!

443
00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:12.488
Are you okay?

444
00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:14.823
I just saw a guy race
outta here and thought...

445
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.386
That you should stop them?

446
00:34:17.503 --> 00:34:19.044
Open your mouth,

447
00:34:19.248 --> 00:34:21.276
and say you thought
that you should stop them.

448
00:34:21.436 --> 00:34:24.590
No, I thought that maybe I should
check to see if you're okay.

449
00:34:24.887 --> 00:34:27.612
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

450
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:30.642
- Everyone else seems stupid.
- Yes. Way to go.

451
00:34:30.877 --> 00:34:32.332
You got that one.

452
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:37.281
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

453
00:34:37.783 --> 00:34:40.968
neutralize it, uncover
the source of its power.

454
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:43.022
And if it resists...

455
00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:45.619
we take it apart,

456
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.640
piece by piece.

457
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:50.748
See what makes it tick.

458
00:34:51.727 --> 00:34:53.139
- Stone.
- Doctor.

459
00:34:53.286 --> 00:34:54.942
Call Optical Illusions.

460
00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:57.329
Tell them I need new frames.

461
00:34:57.966 --> 00:34:59.573
They know what kind I like.

462
00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:03.073
And bring that quill.

463
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:04.948
Yes, Doctor.

464
00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.503
All right, pal,

465
00:35:09.562 --> 00:35:11.231
You need to start talking right now.

466
00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:13.726
Who are you? <i>What</i> are you?

467
00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:16.233
I'm a hedgehog,
I feel like that's obvious.

468
00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:19.007
- And I'm in big trouble.
- You're in big trouble?

469
00:35:19.143 --> 00:35:22.121
You're not the one who punched
some sort of government weirdo back there.

470
00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:24.487
You think you have problems?
I lost my rings!

471
00:35:24.617 --> 00:35:26.151
Rings? What are you talking about?

472
00:35:26.282 --> 00:35:29.755
Okay, rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

473
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:32.463
And now mine are on top
of a pointy building

474
00:35:32.615 --> 00:35:35.386
I've only ever seen
on your skin tight t-shirt.

475
00:35:35.743 --> 00:35:37.904
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

476
00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:41.243
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the Mushroom planet.

477
00:35:43.094 --> 00:35:45.438
- Mushroom planet?
- Yes!

478
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:46.967
Right.

479
00:35:50.828 --> 00:35:53.420
- Okay, pal. Out you go.
- I'm sorry, what?

480
00:35:53.566 --> 00:35:57.433
Look, this is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

481
00:35:57.542 --> 00:35:59.666
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

482
00:35:59.789 --> 00:36:02.720
Now please, go find your rings,
and your Mushroomland.

483
00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:04.992
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in the hospital bed,

484
00:36:05.151 --> 00:36:07.940
and the doctors gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

485
00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:10.302
- Okay? So, goodbye.
- Okay, goodbye.

486
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.923
Goodbye.

487
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:17.224
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

488
00:36:17.363 --> 00:36:18.261
- It's West.
- West?

489
00:36:18.474 --> 00:36:20.740
- Straight shot, can't miss it.
- Fine. That's cool.

490
00:36:20.871 --> 00:36:22.915
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

491
00:36:27.838 --> 00:36:31.680
So, as I crashed into the cold
dark water of the Pacific

492
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.823
I realized a few things.

493
00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.561
A) I have no idea where I'm going;

494
00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:38.925
b) salt water stings.

495
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:43.502
C) I shouldn't even be on this planet
right now, but I am.

496
00:36:43.642 --> 00:36:46.439
- Why? Because you shot me!
- I know.

497
00:36:46.652 --> 00:36:47.733
You shot me!

498
00:36:47.874 --> 00:36:50.541
All right. I heard you the first time.
You don't have to...

499
00:36:50.676 --> 00:36:52.183
pile it on, good grief.

500
00:36:52.361 --> 00:36:54.490
I'm wet. I'm cold.

501
00:36:54.859 --> 00:36:56.599
There's a fish on my head!

502
00:36:56.861 --> 00:37:00.260
And clearly I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

503
00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:08.917
- All right, get in the truck.
- Really? You gonna help me?

504
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:12.191
I guess it is a little bit of my fault
that all of this happening to you.

505
00:37:12.323 --> 00:37:15.216
Not a little bit, entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

506
00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:17.265
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

507
00:37:17.388 --> 00:37:18.495
Yes.

508
00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:22.850
Roadtrip.

509
00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:24.788
What am I doing?

510
00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:27.774
All right, there's gonna be rules
on this trip. Number one:

511
00:37:27.907 --> 00:37:30.111
do exactly as I say all the time.

512
00:37:30.568 --> 00:37:32.405
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

513
00:37:32.548 --> 00:37:34.382
Would you stop with the Donut Lord?

514
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.586
I have a name. It's Tom.

515
00:37:36.924 --> 00:37:38.253
I'm Sonic.

516
00:37:38.447 --> 00:37:40.597
Sonic? Sonic.

517
00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:43.898
So, you've been spying
on us all for years.

518
00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:45.772
I mean, I wouldn't call it spying.

519
00:37:45.904 --> 00:37:48.160
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited,

520
00:37:48.287 --> 00:37:49.794
and no one knew I was there.

521
00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:52.560
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

522
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:55.610
Yeah, you should call him
Super Observing Carl instead.

523
00:37:56.179 --> 00:37:58.459
- Oh my God, stop the car right now!
- What? What?

524
00:37:58.622 --> 00:38:01.945
The World's Largest Rubber Band Ball?
We gotta see it!

525
00:38:02.073 --> 00:38:05.540
No, no. This is not some fun
family roadtrip, okay?

526
00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:09.787
The government wants to dissect you,
and arrest me. This is serious.

527
00:38:11.417 --> 00:38:13.828
You were right. It was lame.
Gift shop was cool, though.

528
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:15.294
I got you a mouse pad.

529
00:38:15.568 --> 00:38:17.153
When are we gonna get there?

530
00:38:17.187 --> 00:38:19.075
We will get there when we get there.

531
00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:41.433
All right, I'm gonna go check in with Wade
to see if he knows what's going on.

532
00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.757
You gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

533
00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:45.856
What is it? A teleportation box?

534
00:38:47.616 --> 00:38:48.568
It's a pay phone.

535
00:38:48.717 --> 00:38:52.126
It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives
from the law, which is us.

536
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:54.777
Stay in the car. I don't want
anybody seeing you.

537
00:38:55.071 --> 00:38:56.379
Fine!

538
00:39:14.902 --> 00:39:19.561
Okay. Okay. That is the coolest place
on Earth, but you have to stay in the car.

539
00:39:28.855 --> 00:39:31.098
Be strong. Be strong.

540
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.536
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

541
00:39:40.686 --> 00:39:43.466
- Wade, it's me.
- Hi, I'm so glad that you called.

542
00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:48.125
So, some guys came in asking
some questions. A little creepy.

543
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.819
Kinda reminded me of guys
from Men in Black,

544
00:39:50.937 --> 00:39:54.407
but not as likable,
or charming as Will Smith.

545
00:39:54.541 --> 00:39:56.145
Wait, what kinda questions?

546
00:39:56.304 --> 00:39:58.561
Questions about terrorism.

547
00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:02.079
I told them that, like...
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

548
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.149
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.
He can't even make, like bait in the cold.

549
00:40:06.278 --> 00:40:08.427
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

550
00:40:08.553 --> 00:40:10.643
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

551
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.682
You know, I think they already know.

552
00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:19.237
Mr. Wachowski.

553
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.324
Tom.

554
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.307
I want you to know
that the only other person

555
00:40:23.369 --> 00:40:26.437
who have ever punched me
in the face was the school bully.

556
00:40:26.566 --> 00:40:29.371
He hit me in the cafeteria
causing a blunt force contusion

557
00:40:29.521 --> 00:40:31.910
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

558
00:40:31.984 --> 00:40:34.083
Humiliated me in front
of the entire school.

559
00:40:34.236 --> 00:40:36.358
And you know what I did in response?

560
00:40:36.515 --> 00:40:39.124
I'm assuming that you reported him
to the Principal's office,

561
00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:41.617
'cause, you know that kinda behavior
is really unacceptable.

562
00:40:41.779 --> 00:40:44.683
No, I examined the inefficiency
of a world with blunt traumed brain,

563
00:40:44.821 --> 00:40:47.619
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

564
00:40:47.766 --> 00:40:50.492
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

565
00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:53.907
And I have never lost
a fight again. Until today.

566
00:40:54.562 --> 00:40:55.887
Hooray for me then, huh?

567
00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:58.644
No, because you're about
to become the bully with a straw!

568
00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:00.985
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

569
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.322
And when I catch you I'll...

570
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:06.292
Hello? Hello?

571
00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:10.025
- Hello? Hello?
- I think he actually hung up.

572
00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:13.408
- Because I noticed that the light isn't on.
- Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

573
00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:15.823
If you give me a second
I can get an outside line.

574
00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:19.929
No, don't be bothered.
You just sit there and be <i>you-</i>

575
00:41:21.135 --> 00:41:22.683
<i>sless.</i>

576
00:41:29.616 --> 00:41:32.273
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

577
00:41:33.472 --> 00:41:35.437
I will tell people about this.

578
00:41:38.543 --> 00:41:41.652
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

579
00:41:42.846 --> 00:41:44.004
Sonic?

580
00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:51.606
No, no.

581
00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:08.228
Howdy, partner.

582
00:42:08.351 --> 00:42:10.140
I'm not your partner, come on,
we're leaving.

583
00:42:10.265 --> 00:42:13.003
But there's a ZZ Top cover band,
you gotta see their beards.

584
00:42:13.086 --> 00:42:15.550
We will have to catch them
some other time. Let's go. Get up.

585
00:42:15.687 --> 00:42:18.999
If we stay I promise I won't say
another word for the rest of the trip.

586
00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:20.562
Starting... now.

587
00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:23.527
Welcome to the Piston Pit,
what can I get you fellas?

588
00:42:23.753 --> 00:42:28.146
I want nachos and buffalo wings, and guac.
Funny word, isn't it? Guac. Guac.

589
00:42:28.884 --> 00:42:31.816
No kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kinda mask?

590
00:42:32.597 --> 00:42:37.181
He's actually 43 years old,
and suffers from a very rare skin disease.

591
00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:39.672
That stunts his growth,
and makes him look...

592
00:42:40.029 --> 00:42:41.429
like... like that.

593
00:42:41.568 --> 00:42:45.500
The face I was born with, the confidence
I picked up along the way.

594
00:42:46.084 --> 00:42:48.445
- Make us a Mellow Yellow please.
- Okay.

595
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:52.289
- You owe me one.
- I've never sat on the bar stool before.

596
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:55.606
So squishy. Oh, look at this, it spins!

597
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:57.687
Yes.

598
00:42:58.344 --> 00:43:00.348
- I feel sick.
- Having fun?

599
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.407
Gonna check this off your bucket list,
huh? Big night for ya?

600
00:43:03.526 --> 00:43:05.355
What's a bucket list?

601
00:43:05.561 --> 00:43:07.233
Bucket list is a...

602
00:43:07.638 --> 00:43:10.839
It's a list of things you wanna do
in your life before you...

603
00:43:11.493 --> 00:43:12.656
well, kick the bucket.

604
00:43:12.767 --> 00:43:15.691
I've never kicked the bucket
either. I gotta make my list.

605
00:43:21.468 --> 00:43:22.887
Sonic.

606
00:43:29.897 --> 00:43:31.009
Why? What's the matter?

607
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:33.017
There are so much stuff
I've never done.

608
00:43:33.176 --> 00:43:35.457
And now that I'm leaving Earth forever...

609
00:43:35.993 --> 00:43:37.800
I guess I missed my chance.

610
00:43:42.963 --> 00:43:46.337
Well, I guess this is the kinda place
you can get a lot of live and done

611
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.206
in a short period of time.

612
00:43:48.772 --> 00:43:50.477
I suppose we can spare an hour.

613
00:43:50.654 --> 00:43:52.984
What? You gonna bucket list with me?

614
00:43:53.312 --> 00:43:55.657
- Sure, why not.
- You won't regret this.

615
00:43:55.891 --> 00:43:57.103
I'm pretty sure I will.

616
00:44:21.883 --> 00:44:23.419
New high score.

617
00:44:29.655 --> 00:44:33.427
Wait a second, does this bull missing
a head or does it have two butts?

618
00:44:35.813 --> 00:44:37.925
- This is easy.
- Okay.

619
00:44:42.664 --> 00:44:44.367
I'm a cowboy, baby.

620
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:48.875
I'm okay.

621
00:44:55.346 --> 00:44:56.492
Yeah!

622
00:44:58.828 --> 00:45:00.440
Yeah, laugh it up.

623
00:45:00.632 --> 00:45:02.238
Nice work, Romeo.

624
00:45:02.717 --> 00:45:05.393
- Glad you're having a good time.
- I am having a good time.

625
00:45:05.505 --> 00:45:08.221
I'm having the best time,
I mean what could go wrong?

626
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.492
Can we help you?

627
00:45:13.845 --> 00:45:17.831
- We don't like your kind around here.
- Our kind? What kind is that?

628
00:45:19.929 --> 00:45:21.124
Hipsters.

629
00:45:21.684 --> 00:45:22.737
How dare you?!

630
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:25.323
Hey, you know what? We were
just leaving anyway, weren't we?

631
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.133
- Not a problem...
- No, no. It's okay.

632
00:45:27.273 --> 00:45:28.216
No, no. We're leaving.

633
00:45:28.352 --> 00:45:30.854
I know exactly how to handle
this situation.

634
00:45:31.941 --> 00:45:33.150
Pop quiz hot-shot.

635
00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.946
You just picked a fight
with a poorly disguised hedgehog

636
00:45:36.087 --> 00:45:38.926
who's seen way too many
action movies. What do you do?

637
00:45:39.048 --> 00:45:40.703
What do you do?

638
00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:45.555
Am I crazy? It was supposed
to break, right?

639
00:45:47.324 --> 00:45:50.148
Break please. Break please.
Break please, bottle. Please.

640
00:45:50.317 --> 00:45:51.689
Sonic?

641
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.894
- Nice doing.
- Thanks. It's awesome, right?

642
00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:08.050
All right, who's next?
Who wants some?

643
00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:09.807
Who do I get to beat up?

644
00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:14.604
Hey, has anybody seen my waitress?
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

645
00:46:15.496 --> 00:46:16.986
Ah, you!

646
00:46:28.466 --> 00:46:29.668
Really?

647
00:48:18.615 --> 00:48:21.382
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

648
00:48:23.546 --> 00:48:24.567
That was amazing!

649
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.661
Wait a second, did we even pay
our tip? It doesn't matter!

650
00:48:27.844 --> 00:48:30.467
Watch this. Watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

651
00:48:33.721 --> 00:48:36.195
- Get them!
- See ya, suckers.

652
00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.548
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

653
00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:47.010
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

654
00:48:47.155 --> 00:48:47.786
Ouch!

655
00:48:47.939 --> 00:48:50.796
- They got you pretty good.
- I'm all right, have been hit harder.

656
00:48:50.954 --> 00:48:52.631
Did you see how much
toilet paper I used?

657
00:48:52.779 --> 00:48:56.291
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with.

658
00:48:56.802 --> 00:49:00.462
The floors were sticky. The crowd
was rough. And the odds were against us.

659
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.962
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

660
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.771
Scratch another one off my list.

661
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.903
You are a weird little dude.

662
00:49:22.415 --> 00:49:24.719
- Okay.
- So, what are we gonna do now?

663
00:49:26.395 --> 00:49:28.455
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.

664
00:49:28.788 --> 00:49:31.276
- You should, too.
- But this is my last night on Earth.

665
00:49:31.408 --> 00:49:33.731
- I wanna soak up every last second.
- All right, well...

666
00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.093
Anything you can find to do in this room,
you knock yourself out.

667
00:49:43.657 --> 00:49:45.749
Good times.

668
00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:49.501
Oh, come on.

669
00:49:49.772 --> 00:49:53.834
- That's awful, what did you eat?
- I think it's called a chili dog.

670
00:49:54.526 --> 00:49:57.216
You might wanna check
your fur on that one, buddy.

671
00:49:57.764 --> 00:50:00.753
Hey, so what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

672
00:50:01.006 --> 00:50:03.861
It's no Earth. I can tell you that.
There's no people.

673
00:50:03.997 --> 00:50:06.918
Just breathable air and giant
mushrooms, and stuff.

674
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.163
Well, look at it this way.

675
00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:11.790
At least you won't be the only <i>fun-gi</i>.

676
00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:15.001
No, don't ever do that again.

677
00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:17.491
I liked it.

678
00:50:19.357 --> 00:50:21.348
I'm really gonna miss this place.

679
00:50:21.608 --> 00:50:25.163
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

680
00:50:26.451 --> 00:50:28.456
Maybe I could have a life here.

681
00:50:33.129 --> 00:50:35.468
All right, we should get some sleep.

682
00:50:36.904 --> 00:50:40.060
You sleep, don't worry about me,
I'm gonna stay up all night

683
00:50:40.204 --> 00:50:41.987
enjoying Earth while I can.

684
00:50:42.181 --> 00:50:43.517
Sure, kid.

685
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.304
As long as we're
on the road by eight.

686
00:51:10.198 --> 00:51:14.318
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

687
00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:17.515
<i>Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

688
00:51:17.778 --> 00:51:20.790
<i>Any information regarding
his whereabouts should be reported</i>

689
00:51:20.942 --> 00:51:22.775
<i>to local authorities immediately.</i>

690
00:51:28.995 --> 00:51:30.949
Did he say where he was going?

691
00:51:34.022 --> 00:51:36.300
Maybe. Maybe not.

692
00:51:37.437 --> 00:51:39.140
Like I'd ever tell you.

693
00:51:40.485 --> 00:51:42.044
Stand down, Agent Stone.

694
00:51:42.116 --> 00:51:44.584
This well-meaning citizen obviously
doesn't understand

695
00:51:44.737 --> 00:51:46.695
the urgency of the matter.

696
00:51:49.025 --> 00:51:50.486
Really?

697
00:51:52.744 --> 00:51:55.456
Now, that's what I call
'good cop, bad cop'.

698
00:51:58.463 --> 00:52:00.051
Left yourself open.

699
00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:04.596
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

700
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.833
the approximate speed of their vehicle
and local weather conditions...

701
00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:10.996
They should be...

702
00:52:11.655 --> 00:52:13.594
right about...

703
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:15.975
here.

704
00:52:16.275 --> 00:52:19.505
- That's brilliant, Sir.
- Thanks... for nothing.

705
00:52:22.436 --> 00:52:24.914
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Me?

706
00:52:25.048 --> 00:52:27.859
- Yeah, everyone has a bucket list, right?
- Well, sure, but...

707
00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:29.836
I mean, you are the one leaving Earth.

708
00:52:30.217 --> 00:52:32.206
And I'm not planning
on dying anytime soon.

709
00:52:32.353 --> 00:52:35.519
Don't be so sure, your best friend
is a magnet for danger.

710
00:52:35.658 --> 00:52:37.575
You're anointing yourself as the bestie?

711
00:52:38.765 --> 00:52:40.738
Little presumptuous,
but... I mean...

712
00:52:41.212 --> 00:52:43.362
I like you, of course, but...

713
00:52:43.591 --> 00:52:45.326
You know, we're not best friends.

714
00:52:45.694 --> 00:52:47.426
You tucked me in last night.

715
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.719
- Fine, fine. Best animal friend.
- That would be my dog Ozzy.

716
00:52:50.828 --> 00:52:54.653
Okay, let's trap this increasingly
humiliating topic of conversation.

717
00:52:54.879 --> 00:52:56.665
Bucket list. Give it to me.

718
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:59.032
Okay, there is one thing.

719
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.861
In Green Hills I've always felt,

720
00:53:02.244 --> 00:53:05.415
I don't know, more like a baby sitter
than a real cop, you know?

721
00:53:05.603 --> 00:53:08.433
So, I want a chance to prove
myself under real pressure.

722
00:53:08.606 --> 00:53:11.371
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

723
00:53:11.986 --> 00:53:14.631
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

724
00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:17.012
What?

725
00:53:18.276 --> 00:53:21.801
- Why is your face doing that?
- You're leaving Green Hills?!

726
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:24.523
- Okay.
- Bu... But... But why?

727
00:53:24.573 --> 00:53:27.634
- Why would you leave Green Hills?
- This maybe hard for you to understand,

728
00:53:27.773 --> 00:53:30.408
but Green Hills is a small town,
it's a very small town.

729
00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:33.008
It's not small. There are
hundreds of people.

730
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:34.706
That's a small town, dude.

731
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.517
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

732
00:53:37.622 --> 00:53:40.968
Please, I clean up their gutters,
I jumpstart their cars in the winter.

733
00:53:41.104 --> 00:53:42.795
They can call anybody to do that.

734
00:53:42.918 --> 00:53:46.427
Sure, they can call anybody,
but the don't. They call you.

735
00:54:03.537 --> 00:54:05.669
Eeny meeny miny...

736
00:54:06.882 --> 00:54:08.263
mayhem.

737
00:54:19.297 --> 00:54:21.455
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

738
00:54:21.479 --> 00:54:23.517
You come from a great town
with great people,

739
00:54:23.667 --> 00:54:26.317
and by my count zero bad guys
trying to kill you.

740
00:54:28.576 --> 00:54:31.046
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

741
00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:33.502
than protecting the people you care about?

742
00:54:39.538 --> 00:54:41.060
Look, I get...

743
00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:44.205
Yeah!

744
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:55.155
You know what? I was wrong about you.
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

745
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.138
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

746
00:54:57.287 --> 00:54:59.871
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?!

747
00:55:05.874 --> 00:55:06.737
Sonic!

748
00:55:06.904 --> 00:55:10.502
I was forced from my home,
your home is perfect and you're leaving it.

749
00:55:10.649 --> 00:55:12.287
Why would you do that?

750
00:55:12.412 --> 00:55:14.742
- Your body!
- No, no! Not again!

751
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.774
- Hey, hold on!
- Why?

752
00:55:16.894 --> 00:55:18.263
Because I'm gonna do this.

753
00:55:36.851 --> 00:55:38.059
Sonic!

754
00:55:39.473 --> 00:55:40.884
Sonic!

755
00:55:44.986 --> 00:55:47.452
Guess I had a bonus life.

756
00:55:50.015 --> 00:55:51.210
Yeah, baby!

757
00:55:51.409 --> 00:55:53.585
Sonic - one, big tank - zero.

758
00:55:53.915 --> 00:55:55.765
I'm sorry. Did we
get this on camera?

759
00:55:55.877 --> 00:55:58.247
- How are you not dead?
- I have no idea.

760
00:55:58.698 --> 00:56:00.036
But do you see me dancing?

761
00:56:00.189 --> 00:56:02.698
- Yes, I saw your dance.
- Is that all you've got?

762
00:56:02.844 --> 00:56:04.782
No, but thank you for asking.

763
00:56:08.502 --> 00:56:09.601
Sonic!

764
00:56:10.053 --> 00:56:12.647
- Get back in the truck!
- You go, I'll catch up.

765
00:56:23.834 --> 00:56:26.110
I think that tank just had a baby.

766
00:56:38.697 --> 00:56:40.131
Incoming!

767
00:56:42.249 --> 00:56:44.857
- It's my turn!
- You just had. Now it's mine!

768
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.131
Hey, stop fighting, or I'm taking
that thing away!

769
00:56:47.312 --> 00:56:48.462
Yeah, right, Dad.

770
00:57:00.368 --> 00:57:02.360
- Where are you going?
- Just drive the car.

771
00:57:02.528 --> 00:57:04.043
I'll take care of this.

772
00:57:04.232 --> 00:57:06.097
And if I don't make it, just ditch me,

773
00:57:06.239 --> 00:57:07.615
you seem good at that.

774
00:57:17.131 --> 00:57:19.290
Hey, everyone, welcome back
to my livestream.

775
00:57:19.408 --> 00:57:21.636
Today, we're destroying robots. Step one.

776
00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:28.385
Yes! We did it!

777
00:57:33.126 --> 00:57:35.641
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

778
00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:38.221
Ever wonder where your
tax dollars are going?

779
00:57:38.377 --> 00:57:40.714
My turn, here,
just keep us going straight.

780
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:42.413
I put on cruise control.

781
00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:46.304
I feel just like Vin Diesel.
It's all about family, Tom.

782
00:57:53.483 --> 00:57:57.272
Quick suggestion. Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

783
00:57:58.509 --> 00:58:00.853
Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive?!

784
00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:03.572
Here, in this truck,
it's happening as we speak.

785
00:58:06.585 --> 00:58:08.505
I can't reach it, bring it in closer.

786
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.012
- What?
- Bring it in closer. Hit the brakes.

787
00:58:11.265 --> 00:58:14.197
- Oh, you mean this one?
- The other brakes!

788
00:58:28.594 --> 00:58:31.762
Give me a big fat break!

789
00:58:37.812 --> 00:58:39.846
This one is cute, let's keep him.

790
00:58:43.448 --> 00:58:44.561
Oh, come on!

791
00:58:44.695 --> 00:58:47.017
How can something so adorable
be so terrible.

792
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:52.245
You got car insurance, right?

793
00:58:58.632 --> 00:59:00.066
Buzz off!

794
00:59:00.452 --> 00:59:03.138
- That doesn't sound good.
- No, beeping means bad! Get rid of it!

795
00:59:03.252 --> 00:59:03.980
I'm trying.

796
00:59:04.099 --> 00:59:06.073
Just throw it off the window!
Throw it anywhere!

797
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.559
- I can't get it off!
- All right, I'm pulling over.

798
00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:17.967
- Did I get it?
- No.

799
00:59:19.759 --> 00:59:21.329
Here, hold still.

800
00:59:22.082 --> 00:59:23.863
It's going. It's going.

801
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:25.467
It's still here.

802
00:59:28.613 --> 00:59:31.832
Get off me! Nailed it!

803
00:59:41.499 --> 00:59:42.826
Sonic!

804
00:59:49.959 --> 00:59:51.176
No, no.

805
00:59:58.195 --> 00:59:59.920
Hey, come on.
You're all right.

806
01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.230
Wake up. Wake up.

807
01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:10.372
Did we get them?

808
01:00:11.093 --> 01:00:12.971
Oh, no, there they are.

809
01:00:13.239 --> 01:00:15.976
They are real survivors, those two.

810
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.705
Can we have a moment?

811
01:00:25.139 --> 01:00:27.171
Pin yourself to the wall.

812
01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:30.325
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

813
01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:34.390
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

814
01:00:34.527 --> 01:00:36.864
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

815
01:00:37.072 --> 01:00:39.019
They're everything to me!

816
01:00:53.518 --> 01:00:55.092
<i>Interesting.</i>

817
01:01:16.863 --> 01:01:19.460
Hold on, buddy. You'll be all right.

818
01:01:19.932 --> 01:01:21.316
You'll be all right.

819
01:01:26.095 --> 01:01:28.933
- I beg you, Rachel. No. It's emergency.
- No, no. Not today. Goodbye. Bye bye.

820
01:01:29.071 --> 01:01:31.050
- Would you stop? Open it please. Maddie!
- Bye. Bye.

821
01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:34.245
- Don't do this to me please. It's important.
- Tom! Oh my God. Rachel let him in!

822
01:01:34.373 --> 01:01:37.137
I am calling the Police. No, I am calling
the FBI. I am calling the CIA.

823
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:38.654
- I am calling someone.
- Don't do that.

824
01:01:38.713 --> 01:01:40.254
- I'm calling your Mother.
- Okay. Got it.

825
01:01:40.388 --> 01:01:42.165
- Maddie, can we just...
- Tom, what's going on?

826
01:01:42.208 --> 01:01:44.418
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

827
01:01:44.442 --> 01:01:46.334
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

828
01:01:46.358 --> 01:01:47.649
- Ditch his phone?
- Track? You?

829
01:01:47.779 --> 01:01:49.465
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey.

830
01:01:49.595 --> 01:01:52.776
- Now your niece is an accessory to treason.
- She's not.

831
01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:56.082
- Would you calm down.
- Calm down? I will not calm down!

832
01:01:56.234 --> 01:01:59.586
Yes, calm down. Stop talking.
No, Ozzy, please. I know, good to see you.

833
01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:02.671
- No, no! Ozzy, stop!
- Oh, good ol' Lord Baby Jesus!

834
01:02:02.894 --> 01:02:05.611
What is that, Tom?
Is it plutonium? Is it emails?

835
01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:09.127
Yes, it's plutonium. Can we just please...
Can we just go to your room and talk...

836
01:02:09.151 --> 01:02:10.251
Stop it, Ozzy! Quit it!

837
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:12.909
- This is why I told you he was no good.
- I'm not engaging...

838
01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.779
- No, Ozzy, quit it!
- Door now open.

839
01:02:14.907 --> 01:02:15.822
- Locked.
- No, it's unlocked.

840
01:02:16.412 --> 01:02:18.495
Ozzy, no! Ozzy! No, no!

841
01:02:20.187 --> 01:02:21.625
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

842
01:02:23.689 --> 01:02:25.363
Oh, thank God!

843
01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:27.890
Can I get a glass of water?

844
01:04:09.067 --> 01:04:12.547
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

845
01:04:13.002 --> 01:04:16.348
What do I look like, an imbecile?
Of course, I want a latte!

846
01:04:16.568 --> 01:04:18.487
I love the way you make them!

847
01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:27.444
Ready the prototype.

848
01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:33.379
With this kind of power my machines
can finally reach their full potential.

849
01:04:39.783 --> 01:04:41.639
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

850
01:04:43.031 --> 01:04:45.381
Oh, thank God.
He's gonna be okay, right?

851
01:04:45.678 --> 01:04:48.415
I'm a vet, Tom, I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

852
01:04:48.545 --> 01:04:50.504
Well, he's a hedgehog...
Or so he says.

853
01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:52.398
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

854
01:04:52.703 --> 01:04:53.720
Okay.

855
01:04:55.478 --> 01:04:56.562
- Holy...
- What?

856
01:04:56.737 --> 01:04:58.357
Its pulse is super fast.

857
01:04:58.499 --> 01:05:00.618
Well, that actually
might be normal for him.

858
01:05:00.671 --> 01:05:03.974
- I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.
- I don't know his physiology.

859
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:07.027
He doesn't seem to have
any broken bones. He's just...

860
01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:09.452
really banged up.

861
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.717
Look at its poor little feet.

862
01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:18.922
Hang in there, buddy.
You gonna be all right.

863
01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:24.788
Jojo, untie your Mo... Jojo!

864
01:05:25.215 --> 01:05:27.825
Untie Mommy. Sweetie.

865
01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:29.651
Jojo!

866
01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:34.160
I have to go to the bathroom.

867
01:05:34.307 --> 01:05:36.000
He's gonna be okay, right?

868
01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:38.680
Like he's gonna snap outta this.
He'll wake up soon.

869
01:05:38.877 --> 01:05:41.178
Oh, smelling salts! Don't you have
like vet smelling salts,

870
01:05:41.319 --> 01:05:43.547
like for cats, or parakeets or something?

871
01:05:43.697 --> 01:05:46.615
- No, they don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

872
01:05:47.045 --> 01:05:51.124
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

873
01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:53.654
Okay.

874
01:05:55.853 --> 01:05:57.001
Come on, buddy.

875
01:05:57.148 --> 01:05:58.480
Gotta go fast!

876
01:06:01.897 --> 01:06:04.256
Where am I? What year is it?
Is the Rock President?

877
01:06:04.382 --> 01:06:06.328
Whoa, whoa, buddy.
You're okay. Calm down.

878
01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:08.670
- Oh, hi Pretzel Lady!
- Hi.

879
01:06:09.592 --> 01:06:10.592
Tom?

880
01:06:10.763 --> 01:06:12.545
- Yeah?
- Can I talk to you please?

881
01:06:15.711 --> 01:06:17.758
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

882
01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.072
You got it. I am great at resting.
I rest better than anybody.

883
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.846
Still talking.

884
01:06:22.974 --> 01:06:26.611
First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been.

885
01:06:26.726 --> 01:06:28.089
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

886
01:06:28.206 --> 01:06:30.066
- No.
- Totally calm.

887
01:06:30.474 --> 01:06:32.018
Thank you.

888
01:06:32.736 --> 01:06:34.426
Second of all,

889
01:06:34.939 --> 01:06:37.882
what the heck is going on?!
Is that thing an alien?

890
01:06:38.038 --> 01:06:42.444
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the Blue Devil?

891
01:06:43.323 --> 01:06:45.438
- That's him. He's real?
- Dah!

892
01:06:45.562 --> 01:06:48.033
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

893
01:06:49.174 --> 01:06:52.328
I kinda sorta shot our little blue friend
with your tranq gun.

894
01:06:52.453 --> 01:06:54.756
- No, you did not!
- I didn't... I didn't mean to.

895
01:06:54.871 --> 01:06:56.927
Okay, this is kinda hard
for me to explain.

896
01:06:56.992 --> 01:06:58.728
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

897
01:06:58.854 --> 01:07:02.204
He has to get to the Transamerica
building, and I promised I'd take him.

898
01:07:03.533 --> 01:07:04.668
Aliens?

899
01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.942
Maddie, your husband's
lost his mind.

900
01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:10.695
You can use this as an opportunity
to leave him. No one would judge you.

901
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.078
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

902
01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:19.934
Really?

903
01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.216
No one's ever given me a gift before.

904
01:07:24.025 --> 01:07:26.226
I gotta check it off my bucket list.

905
01:07:35.606 --> 01:07:37.527
All right. Lookin' good.

906
01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:41.810
Okay.

907
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.971
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

908
01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:46.821
Well, that's what you're doing.

909
01:07:47.016 --> 01:07:50.520
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as <i>people,</i> right?

910
01:07:50.678 --> 01:07:51.934
- I think so, too.
- Yeah.

911
01:07:52.063 --> 01:07:53.579
- I think.
- Okay.

912
01:07:53.739 --> 01:07:57.429
I love you. Did I tell you that already?
I don't deserve you, you know that?

913
01:07:57.618 --> 01:07:59.165
I know that.

914
01:08:01.659 --> 01:08:02.647
So,

915
01:08:02.747 --> 01:08:06.331
you're supposed to be Tom's best friend
that he won't shut up about.

916
01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:09.742
Well, I don't see the appeal.

917
01:08:11.525 --> 01:08:14.218
Stop. That is very gross.

918
01:08:16.334 --> 01:08:17.389
- Hey.
- Hey.

919
01:08:17.501 --> 01:08:18.600
So,

920
01:08:18.733 --> 01:08:20.858
my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much total.

921
01:08:20.977 --> 01:08:23.174
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

922
01:08:23.302 --> 01:08:25.094
You have got to be kidding me!

923
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.049
- She'll be fine.
- Yes, let's do that.

924
01:08:28.394 --> 01:08:30.586
This is my house!

925
01:08:32.976 --> 01:08:36.270
Whoa, whoa... Now this is my turn.
And I pull around him.

926
01:08:36.418 --> 01:08:38.931
Sorry. And... perfect park.

927
01:08:39.232 --> 01:08:41.952
- What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

928
01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:44.842
- Why did we let the alien drive?
- Hey, I got us here.

929
01:08:45.006 --> 01:08:46.916
And please, five stars.

930
01:08:48.108 --> 01:08:49.468
So, this is it?

931
01:08:49.654 --> 01:08:51.301
That's it. That's your pyramid.

932
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:54.903
- Wow! Look at that thing.
- What happens now?

933
01:08:55.809 --> 01:08:58.379
- Oh, he's... gone.
- Yup.

934
01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:02.339
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

935
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.896
What now?

936
01:09:05.059 --> 01:09:08.251
Time for me to abuse the power
entrusted to me.

937
01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.483
We got a jumper on the roof.

938
01:09:19.605 --> 01:09:22.934
Gotta get up there fast, or we gonna have
a human pancake on our hands.

939
01:09:23.105 --> 01:09:25.411
You came all the way from Montana?

940
01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.887
Yup, that's how serious it is.

941
01:09:32.327 --> 01:09:33.669
Okay.

942
01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:36.704
You just saved a life.

943
01:09:40.168 --> 01:09:41.528
Come on. Come on.

944
01:09:45.345 --> 01:09:47.994
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

945
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:52.460
Hello? Anybody there?

946
01:09:52.624 --> 01:09:54.578
Do you have your child in that bag?

947
01:09:54.809 --> 01:09:55.952
No.

948
01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:58.566
I mean yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

949
01:09:59.688 --> 01:10:01.065
It's not your child?

950
01:10:01.429 --> 01:10:03.460
Relax, I'm a cop, okay?

951
01:10:03.582 --> 01:10:05.413
Plus he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

952
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:06.847
Why would I like it in here?

953
01:10:06.987 --> 01:10:09.873
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

954
01:10:10.584 --> 01:10:12.326
Such a kidder.

955
01:10:13.332 --> 01:10:14.748
Okay.

956
01:10:14.859 --> 01:10:17.499
No, I'm scared of the dark!
Is anybody there?

957
01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:32.800
What were you keeping in this bag?

958
01:10:33.033 --> 01:10:34.763
A jar of pickled farts?

959
01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:37.206
All right, all right,
what are we looking for?

960
01:10:39.756 --> 01:10:41.034
This!

961
01:10:41.495 --> 01:10:43.623
Okay, what happens now?

962
01:10:43.733 --> 01:10:47.145
Now, all I have to do is think of where
I want the other end of the ring to appear,

963
01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:48.967
- and I throw it.
- So, that's it?

964
01:10:49.343 --> 01:10:51.270
- We did it?
- Yeah. We did it.

965
01:10:51.996 --> 01:10:55.485
Hey, sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

966
01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:58.481
It's okay. I did the ones
I needed the most.

967
01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:03.105
- You two are so cute, like...
- Oh, please. What?

968
01:11:03.245 --> 01:11:05.287
- We are not.
- No, we're not cute.

969
01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:08.558
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

970
01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.222
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Really?

971
01:11:10.365 --> 01:11:13.521
And our rules include expressing
heartfelt emotions.

972
01:11:13.672 --> 01:11:14.849
If you say so.

973
01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.586
Okay then.

974
01:11:16.869 --> 01:11:17.919
All right.

975
01:11:18.995 --> 01:11:20.995
- You gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go, so...

976
01:11:21.112 --> 01:11:24.284
- I gotta go. We gotta go, too.
- So, see... All right. Bye bye.

977
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.112
Just one more thing.

978
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:40.324
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

979
01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:45.593
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

980
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:48.666
Walking away from something
you care about

981
01:11:49.136 --> 01:11:50.823
has to be painful.

982
01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:52.998
You're not sure you really wanna go, huh?

983
01:11:53.835 --> 01:11:56.740
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

984
01:11:57.279 --> 01:12:00.050
As long as I'm here
I put everyone in danger.

985
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:01.916
I can't do that.

986
01:12:02.857 --> 01:12:05.575
I just want you to know
that these last two days

987
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:09.458
have been the best two days of my life.

988
01:12:12.525 --> 01:12:14.196
You know I never though I'd say this

989
01:12:14.328 --> 01:12:16.838
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little Blue Devil.

990
01:12:16.985 --> 01:12:19.031
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

991
01:12:19.864 --> 01:12:21.021
Thank you.

992
01:12:21.732 --> 01:12:23.012
For what?

993
01:12:23.642 --> 01:12:25.223
For saving my life.

994
01:12:43.213 --> 01:12:46.114
Okay, did someone leave
their 'Find my Phone' on?

995
01:13:12.415 --> 01:13:15.476
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

996
01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.995
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

997
01:13:18.109 --> 01:13:20.529
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us,

998
01:13:20.644 --> 01:13:21.473
unsuccessfully.

999
01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:23.957
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

1000
01:13:24.089 --> 01:13:25.585
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1001
01:13:27.117 --> 01:13:28.593
It's a flight suit.

1002
01:13:28.773 --> 01:13:31.436
Designed to modulate my body temperature
and reduce drag.

1003
01:13:31.665 --> 01:13:33.560
Yeah, and yet you're still are one.

1004
01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:36.828
Good one, you are catching fire, Thomas.

1005
01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:40.114
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1006
01:13:40.257 --> 01:13:43.818
Does she have a name, or should
we just call her 'collateral damage'?

1007
01:13:44.027 --> 01:13:45.239
Hey, watch your mouth!

1008
01:13:45.383 --> 01:13:47.810
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1009
01:13:47.934 --> 01:13:49.015
Punched him in a face.

1010
01:13:49.132 --> 01:13:51.506
Oh, you punched him right in the face.
It was awesome.

1011
01:13:51.643 --> 01:13:54.542
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1012
01:13:54.675 --> 01:13:57.506
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,
Mr. Eggman.

1013
01:13:57.738 --> 01:14:00.168
But let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1014
01:14:00.307 --> 01:14:01.834
Confidence,

1015
01:14:02.111 --> 01:14:04.400
a fool's substitute for intelligence.

1016
01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:13.555
That's not good.

1017
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:17.148
Sonic, I know you got the super speed
and everything, but Maddie and I...

1018
01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:19.418
Totally defenseless,
probably gonna get blown up?

1019
01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:20.862
Pretty much, yeah.

1020
01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:24.141
Don't worry, I know exactly what to do.

1021
01:14:31.337 --> 01:14:33.319
I was not expecting that.

1022
01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:36.740
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1023
01:15:37.098 --> 01:15:38.350
Come on!

1024
01:15:38.478 --> 01:15:40.674
Com... Com...
Come on! Come on!

1025
01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.621
Hi Tom. Glad you're here.

1026
01:16:09.759 --> 01:16:12.971
Could use some help.
Old Bessie is about to give birth.

1027
01:16:13.637 --> 01:16:14.985
Give me a minute.

1028
01:16:17.697 --> 01:16:20.806
Can I give you one
genius piece of advice?

1029
01:16:21.397 --> 01:16:22.809
Don't run.

1030
01:16:22.949 --> 01:16:25.091
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1031
01:16:25.311 --> 01:16:27.687
And it's bad for your joints,
they proved it.

1032
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:31.564
All right, Eggman, you wanna get fast?
Let's get fast.

1033
01:16:34.545 --> 01:16:36.466
The hard way it is.

1034
01:16:55.192 --> 01:16:57.493
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1035
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.582
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1036
01:17:01.724 --> 01:17:03.450
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

1037
01:17:03.567 --> 01:17:06.091
<i>Now you understand
why there's a psychotic robot-doctor</i>

1038
01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.453
<i>chasing a super sonic blue hedgehog.</i>

1039
01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:09.801
<i>Wanna know how it ends?</i>

1040
01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:11.405
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

1041
01:17:28.828 --> 01:17:32.236
How is this possible?! No one's ever
caught up to me before.

1042
01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:41.500
Coming through!

1043
01:17:44.457 --> 01:17:46.419
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur.</i>

1044
01:17:50.341 --> 01:17:52.881
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1045
01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.389
I can't lose him!

1046
01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:20.301
If you can't beat him, blind him.

1047
01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:25.391
Lost visual contact.

1048
01:18:30.136 --> 01:18:32.183
You're not allowed up there!

1049
01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:34.480
It's one of the Seven Wonders.

1050
01:18:58.412 --> 01:19:00.699
- Get out of here!
- Go! Go!

1051
01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:10.981
You're an astonishing little creature.

1052
01:19:13.643 --> 01:19:15.645
It'll be funny to take you back to the lab

1053
01:19:15.801 --> 01:19:18.366
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1054
01:19:19.008 --> 01:19:21.312
Any last words?

1055
01:19:21.509 --> 01:19:22.923
Guac.

1056
01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:24.809
I like that word.

1057
01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:28.208
I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs

1058
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:30.711
have been made possible
by animal testing.

1059
01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:32.186
You're being very selfish.

1060
01:19:32.327 --> 01:19:34.164
- Going my way?
- What a...

1061
01:19:39.757 --> 01:19:41.924
Who the hell do you think you are?!

1062
01:19:45.007 --> 01:19:46.995
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...

1063
01:19:51.589 --> 01:19:53.720
Autopilot, adjust.

1064
01:19:54.167 --> 01:19:55.328
Why?

1065
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:58.899
Why would you throw
your life away for this <i>thing</i>?

1066
01:19:59.055 --> 01:20:00.598
That's why I don't have friends.

1067
01:20:00.756 --> 01:20:02.761
Next thing you know, you're
somebody's best man,

1068
01:20:02.908 --> 01:20:04.638
they wanna have
the wedding out of town.

1069
01:20:04.777 --> 01:20:06.861
Like nobody has
anything better to do!

1070
01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:09.093
Anyway, where were we?

1071
01:20:09.289 --> 01:20:10.399
Oh, yes,

1072
01:20:10.569 --> 01:20:12.306
you were about to die.

1073
01:20:14.232 --> 01:20:16.366
It's our Sheriff you're messing with.

1074
01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.359
Do you know Blue Devil?

1075
01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.553
Who everyone can see
is a very real creature,

1076
01:20:22.937 --> 01:20:25.906
and not at all invented by me!

1077
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.050
- Be careful.
- Just... pull it away...

1078
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.389
Tom.

1079
01:20:44.688 --> 01:20:46.999
I don't mean to be indelicate here.

1080
01:20:47.365 --> 01:20:50.400
But someone should get some ice
to keep the body fresh.

1081
01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:55.792
He's just a silly little alien.

1082
01:20:56.028 --> 01:20:57.978
He didn't belong here!

1083
01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:01.080
That little alien

1084
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:05.111
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1085
01:21:05.908 --> 01:21:07.779
His name was Sonic.

1086
01:21:08.145 --> 01:21:09.957
This was his home.

1087
01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:12.433
And he was my friend.

1088
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:38.726
He's all yours.

1089
01:21:39.992 --> 01:21:41.405
Everyone get back!

1090
01:21:44.895 --> 01:21:47.783
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1091
01:21:58.495 --> 01:22:00.406
This is my power!

1092
01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:03.007
And I'm not using it
to run away anymore.

1093
01:22:03.188 --> 01:22:06.453
I'm using it to protect my friends!

1094
01:23:04.984 --> 01:23:06.332
Now you've done it!

1095
01:23:06.497 --> 01:23:09.196
Guess what, Eggman,
I'm not leaving Earth.

1096
01:23:09.367 --> 01:23:10.736
You are!

1097
01:23:10.874 --> 01:23:12.225
Donut Lord?

1098
01:24:01.081 --> 01:24:03.837
- Told you you got this.
- Hey, we got this.

1099
01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:19.098
- These belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1100
01:24:19.936 --> 01:24:21.960
No more pushing people off the buildings.

1101
01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:23.750
You know I can't promise that.

1102
01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:29.930
- You did pretty good, space hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1103
01:24:30.079 --> 01:24:32.906
You gonna have to explain
this 'Donut Lord' thing.

1104
01:24:33.061 --> 01:24:35.612
Nope, sorry, that's for me
and our little guy. Right?

1105
01:24:35.911 --> 01:24:38.056
We got our thing, you got
your thing with your...

1106
01:24:38.175 --> 01:24:39.793
- sister.
- Oh my God, my sister.

1107
01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.292
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1108
01:24:44.043 --> 01:24:46.102
Jojo, put on my Fitbit.

1109
01:24:46.898 --> 01:24:48.716
Then I'll at least get some steps.

1110
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.699
We can never go back there.

1111
01:24:51.577 --> 01:24:53.109
I mean, are we?

1112
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.517
'Cause it kinda feels like
we're home right now.

1113
01:24:58.022 --> 01:24:59.731
Really?

1114
01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:03.426
I kinda feel like I checked
the 'save the life'

1115
01:25:03.594 --> 01:25:05.445
box off my bucket list.

1116
01:25:07.878 --> 01:25:11.627
Now all I wanna do is to spend my life
with the people I care about.

1117
01:25:13.096 --> 01:25:15.152
I wanna check that box.

1118
01:25:15.605 --> 01:25:17.517
Okay. I like that.

1119
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:20.348
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1120
01:25:20.886 --> 01:25:23.555
Disperse. Just another
ordinary day in Green Hills.

1121
01:25:23.706 --> 01:25:25.529
Carl, I'll take that chainsaw.

1122
01:25:25.825 --> 01:25:27.611
Come on, let's go!

1123
01:25:27.803 --> 01:25:29.968
You act like you've never seen
a fight between

1124
01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:34.073
an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1125
01:25:43.213 --> 01:25:44.675
You got enough there?

1126
01:25:44.944 --> 01:25:47.005
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- You need any more?

1127
01:25:47.234 --> 01:25:48.557
Get that...

1128
01:25:59.223 --> 01:26:01.220
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1129
01:26:01.888 --> 01:26:03.231
Yes?

1130
01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:07.385
A token of appreciation
from your government.

1131
01:26:07.552 --> 01:26:10.850
For keeping quiet about recent
incidents, which never occurred.

1132
01:26:12.922 --> 01:26:14.191
Wow!

1133
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:17.089
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1134
01:26:17.254 --> 01:26:19.507
- Letter from the President?
- You'll see.

1135
01:26:19.949 --> 01:26:21.439
Okay.

1136
01:26:24.347 --> 01:26:26.559
- Olive Garden?
- Yeah.

1137
01:26:26.847 --> 01:26:28.385
The way you said "you'll see"

1138
01:26:28.549 --> 01:26:31.115
made me think it was something
better than the things we said.

1139
01:26:31.258 --> 01:26:33.471
Have you tried their
'Never Ending Pasta Bowl'?

1140
01:26:33.698 --> 01:26:35.328
It never ends.

1141
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.276
That sounds fancy.

1142
01:26:37.482 --> 01:26:40.236
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1143
01:26:40.867 --> 01:26:44.007
Oh, hey, I guess we can close
the file on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1144
01:26:44.175 --> 01:26:45.563
Just disappeared?

1145
01:26:45.722 --> 01:26:49.599
I'm sorry, but, no such person exists,
or ever has existed.

1146
01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.028
I wish that was true.

1147
01:26:52.194 --> 01:26:54.052
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1148
01:26:54.195 --> 01:26:56.767
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1149
01:26:56.939 --> 01:26:58.831
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1150
01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.393
Very casual, brunch perhaps.

1151
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:06.007
Oh, you mean the little blue guy?
No, no. Nothing.

1152
01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:09.192
Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.

1153
01:27:10.557 --> 01:27:12.739
- Very well.
- Okay.

1154
01:27:13.234 --> 01:27:15.076
- Thank you.
- Great.

1155
01:27:17.306 --> 01:27:18.607
Yup.

1156
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:24.529
To be honest, I'm pretty pumped
about the pasta bowl.

1157
01:27:25.053 --> 01:27:26.921
So, you guys wanna watch a movie or what?

1158
01:27:27.056 --> 01:27:30.301
Sorry, buddy, it's a school night,
it's time for you to go back to your cave.

1159
01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.030
What? It's three in the afternoon!

1160
01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:34.093
You know how you get
when you're tired, come on.

1161
01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:35.698
Me? I'm not like anything.

1162
01:27:35.838 --> 01:27:38.858
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah. We know.

1163
01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:42.783
- Hey, buddy, where are you going?
- You said I have to go back to my cave.

1164
01:27:42.919 --> 01:27:44.101
We did.

1165
01:27:59.675 --> 01:28:01.880
Oh my... Are you kidding me?

1166
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.404
I can't believe it.

1167
01:28:04.716 --> 01:28:05.952
How did you...

1168
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:08.918
It... This is... It's all here.

1169
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.240
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the bean bag? No way!

1170
01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.600
How did you even get this?
How did you get it all over?

1171
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:28.473
I love it, I love it!

1172
01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.760
Well, welcome home.

1173
01:28:34.996 --> 01:28:37.473
Thank you so much.

1174
01:28:46.308 --> 01:28:47.788
Oh, no, you don't.

1175
01:28:47.954 --> 01:28:50.966
No second best animal friends
allowed in my room.

1176
01:28:51.465 --> 01:28:53.738
Wait, what are you doing?
Stay away from me.

1177
01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:56.845
Stop it. I'm warning you,
I've got nunchucks.

1178
01:28:57.024 --> 01:28:59.547
Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.

1179
01:29:16.876 --> 01:29:20.224
My grasp on sanity remains absolute.

1180
01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:23.875
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

1181
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.987
Why don't you get a head start.

1182
01:29:32.904 --> 01:29:35.208
Do some rockconnaissance.

1183
01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:38.865
Rockconnaissance.
Come on, that's hilarious.

1184
01:29:39.022 --> 01:29:40.838
What's the matter with you?!

1185
01:29:41.154 --> 01:29:44.492
Here's the sitch. Uninhabited planet.

1186
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:48.103
No resources. No supplies.

1187
01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:50.184
No apparent way home.

1188
01:29:52.268 --> 01:29:54.537
A lesser man would die here.

1189
01:29:57.105 --> 01:29:59.333
I'll be home by Christmas.

1190
01:30:18.269 --> 01:30:20.745
Rockconnaissance!

1191
01:30:23.566 --> 01:30:25.390
Come on, cheer up!

1192
01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:29.541
There is a post-credits scene
at 01:32:04! Stay tuned.

1194
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:29.954
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1195
01:32:30.117 --> 01:32:31.437
I found him!

1196
01:32:31.573 --> 01:32:33.352
I just hope I'm not too late.
